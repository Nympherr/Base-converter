# Base-converter
**What this program does:**

It is a base converter which allows user to convert any real number(f.e. 123.2456 or ABC.DE) from base 2-36 to any other base in range 2-36. Implementation was done manually, no helpful methods or libraries were used (f.e. method toString(), which can automatically convert a number to a chosen system)

**How to use it:**

Open index.html in the browser

**What have I learnt by doing this project:**

1) From the beginning I should create a long-term plan on how I will be doing things so that later I would not have to redo stuff

2) If I cannot come up with the solution for some time I should leave, refresh my mind and come back later, instead of gazing at the computer with no work actually being done

3) Testing is very important and it is important to have efficient testing system so you would not have to waste a lot of time repeating the same tasks

4) How javascript numbers work ( especially long float numbers, when imprecision occurs )

5) Used bigDecimal library to accurately calculate floating numbers

6) Learnt more about javascript objects, how they work and how to use them

7) How to convert numbers from one system to another

8) Improved debugging skills with google-chrome Dev tools
